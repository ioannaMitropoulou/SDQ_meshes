# SDQ_meshes

This repository contains the code used for the publication **Fabrication-aware strip-decomposable quadrilateral meshes**, by Ioanna Mitropoulou, Amir Vaxman, Olga Diamanti, Benjamin Dillenburger, published in Computer-Aided Design, Volume 168, 2024, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cad.2023.103666.

In particular, the code implements;
* The vector field optimization method presented in that paper, where two transversal 2-fields are optimized jointly and integrated in two coupled strip networks (publication, Section 4).
* The overlay of the two networks into a Strip-Decomposable Quad (SDQ) mesh (publication, Section 4.4).
* Strip-based editing operations to fix topologic defects of the strip networks (publication, Section 5).
